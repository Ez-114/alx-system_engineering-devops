# 🎭 Postmortem: The Great Database Meltdown of 2024-08-18 🎭

---

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** The *unfortunate* downtime lasted for 3 hours, from 08:15 AM to 11:15 AM UTC on 2024-08-18. (In IT years, that’s practically a lifetime! 🕰️)
- **Impact:** Our primary database decided to take an unexpected vacation, rendering all our web applications unresponsive. 🛌 Roughly 85% of our users were left staring at loading screens, probably questioning their life choices.
- **Root Cause:** A well-intended but misconfigured failover script triggered a **database deadlock**, bringing everything to a grinding halt. It was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole… in the dark.

## Timeline

- **08:15 AM UTC:** 🚨 *Alert!* Our monitoring system sent out a distress signal indicating the database was moving slower than a snail in molasses.
- **08:16 AM UTC:** Engineer on call: “Houston, we have a problem.” Users were unable to access the site.
- **08:20 AM UTC:** The team first suspected a network glitch and went on a wild goose chase looking for packet loss. 
- **08:40 AM UTC:** Oh, look! Maybe we’re under a DDoS attack? Nope, false alarm. 🥸
- **09:00 AM UTC:** The Database Operations Team was called in like the IT cavalry. 🏇
- **09:15 AM UTC:** *Aha!* Discovered that our failover was *failing over* a little too hard and got stuck.
- **10:00 AM UTC:** Rebooted the system, reran the failover, and crossed our fingers. 🤞
- **11:15 AM UTC:** Database was back up and running, and so were our apologies to the users. 🙈

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** The issue was a **deadlock** in the database cluster. When our automated failover kicked in, it tripped over a configuration mistake and got stuck in a loop, effectively locking up the system like a badly written cliffhanger.
  
- **Resolution:** We manually stepped in, reconfigured the nodes, and gently persuaded them to cooperate. The failover was rerun correctly, and with a sigh of relief, services were restored. 🍾

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - 🚑 *“Doctor, it hurts when I configure this way…”* Let’s review and patch that pesky failover script.
  - 🚨 Add more monitoring, because you can never have too many alarms blaring at 3 AM. (Just kidding, but only sort of.)
  - 🕵️‍♂️ Let’s do a deep dive into our database setup and make sure there are no more skeletons in the closet.

- **Action Items:**
  - [ ] Patch the failover script and test it until it cries uncle.
  - [ ] Automate failover testing during maintenance so we don’t accidentally break things. Again.
  - [ ] Increase logging during failovers so next time we’ll know exactly what happened, instead of playing *Clue: IT Edition*.
  - [ ] Schedule a team training session on the new failover process—everyone loves a good lunch-and-learn, right? 🍕
  - [ ] Let’s run a disaster recovery drill, because practice makes perfect, or at least better.
